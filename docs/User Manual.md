# **Project Sentinel – User Manual**

## **1. Overview**
Project Sentinel is a wearable safety device designed to monitor hazardous work environments in real time. It integrates multiple sensors—gas, temperature, humidity, motion, and vital signs—with advanced connectivity (BLE and LTE/LoRa), data analysis, and alerting to protect personnel in high‑risk occupations.
### **1.1 Key Features**
- **Real‑Time Environmental Monitoring:** Detects combustible gases (CO, methane, ammonia), temperature, and humidity.

- **Motion & Fall Detection:** Accelerometer and gyroscope sense sudden impacts or falls.

- **Wearer Health Monitoring:** Heart rate and blood oxygen (SpO₂) sensing.

- **Intelligent Alerts:** Instant notifications sent via Bluetooth or cellular network when thresholds are exceeded.

- **Historical Insights:** Data logged for trend analysis and risk prediction.
